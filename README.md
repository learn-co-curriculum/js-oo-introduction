# JavaScript OO Introduction

## Objective

Learn how object oriented programing works in JavaScript.

## Overview

After sitting in front of your computer for the last 48 hours writing some awesome code, you realize you should get some exercise too. Maybe a bike ride? But before you put on some spandex shorts and hop on a bike, let's write some more code!

You will be building two JavaScript objects: an `owner` and a `bike`. The owner has several bikes, can build a new bike, and can go on a ride using any of their bikes. Each bike has 2 wheels, a color, and knows what kind of condition it's in. After a long bike ride, the owner will need to give the bike a tune up.

Here's a quick reference for creating objects with JavaScript:

```javascript
// constructor (unique for each object)
function Pet (name, kind) {
  this.name = name;
  this.kind = kind;
}

// instance methods
Pet.prototype.speak = function(){
    if ( this.kind == 'dog' ){
      return 'woof';
    } else if (this.kind == 'cat'){
      return 'meow';
    } else{
      return 'hello, I\'m a ' + this.kind;
    }
  }
};

// creating a new object
vivian = new Pet('Lady Vivian the Terrible', 'dog');
zargon = new Pet('Zargon', 'fish');
vivian.speak();
// -> woof
zargon.speak();
// -> hello, I'm a fish
```

## Instructions

- Flesh out the Bike and Owner constructors
- Bike instances have a `name`, `type`, `color`, and 'condition' properties
  - `condition` is by default equal to 'ready to go!'
- Owner instances have a `name` and `bikes` properties
- Bikes have a constant called `WHEELS` set to 2
- Bikes have `#takeForARide` method that, if more than 50 miles are traveled it sets the `condition` property to 'needs a tune up'
- Bikes have a `#tuneUp` method that sets the `condition` property to 'ready to go!'
- Owners have a `#buildBikes` method that creates a new bike that they then own
- Owners have a `#rideBike` method that only works on bikes that they own
  - this method takes a number of miles as an argument

## Tests
Run the Jasmine test and build out your objects. The test should help guide you.

```shell
# Install jasmine:
gem sources -a http://flatiron:33west26@gems.flatironschool.com
gem install learn-co

# Run Jasmine test suite:
learn  # runs only in the terminal
learn -b # runs also in the browser
```
